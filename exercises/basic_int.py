# Implement the BasicInt class
#
# As the name suggests, the BasicInt class should hold the value of an
# integer variable (this kind of classes are sometimes called 'wrappers').
# At this stage we want to keep it simple, so your class only needs to
# follow a few simple rules:
# 1) If it is initialized without arguments, it should hold the value 0.
# 2) If it is initialized with an integer argument, it should hold the given value.
# 3) It should implement the function 'get' which returns the stored value.
# 4) It should support 4 basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication and
# integer division (see https://mathworld.wolfram.com/IntegerDivision.html).
# Each operation should be implemented by an appropriately named function: 'add', 'sub',
# 'mul' and 'div', respectively. Moreover, each should take a single integer argument,
# representing the value to be added, subtracted and so on (e.g., the call 'add(3)'
# should add 3 to the value stored by the BasicInt object).
#
# For now, assume that the user will always use the class as intended, that is, he/she
# will always use integers for both initialization and operations (note: NEVER assume that
# when developing real software!)
